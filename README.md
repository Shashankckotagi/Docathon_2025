🧠 GutSense AI

AI Agent for Early Screening of Gastrointestinal Diseases

GutSense is an AI-based clinical assistant that predicts the risk of multiple gastrointestinal conditions from patient data.
The system uses XGBoost as the core machine learning model and provides transparent explainability for every prediction.

A doctor-in-the-loop workflow ensures that all AI results are reviewed, validated, and approved by a medical professional before reaching the patient.

✨ Key Idea

Predicts multi-disease risk levels

Uses XGBoost for classification

Shows why the prediction was made (explainability)

Doctor has full control to approve or reject results

Patients receive a clear, personalized report

🎯 Vision

To make gastrointestinal disease screening faster, explainable, and doctor-supervised, enabling early intervention and better treatment decisions.

🥼 Clinical Philosophy

AI assists — doctors decide.
GutSense is designed to support clinical judgment, not replace it.
