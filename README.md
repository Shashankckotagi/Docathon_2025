🧠 GutSense AI

AI Agent for Early Screening of Gastrointestinal Diseases

GutSense is an AI-driven clinical assistant designed to support doctors in identifying gastrointestinal diseases at an early stage. The system analyzes patient data, predicts the likelihood of multiple GI conditions, and provides transparent reasoning behind every result.

A human-in-the-loop flow ensures that doctors review and validate all AI-generated outputs before patients receive any recommendations, keeping clinical safety at the center.

✨ Key Idea

Predict risk levels for multiple gastrointestinal diseases

Explain why the model reached a decision (SHAP-based)

Doctors stay in control: approve or reject predictions

Patients receive clear, personalized insights

Focus on early detection and better treatment decisions

🎯 Vision

To make gastrointestinal disease screening faster, explainable, and doctor-supervised, enabling early intervention and informed treatment planning.

🥼 Clinical Philosophy

AI assists — doctors decide.
GutSense is designed to support, not replace, medical judgment.

📁 Note on Dataset

The original dataset used for this project is over 1GB in size and contains 590+ feature columns.
Because it exceeds GitHub’s storage limits and Git LFS quota, the dataset is not included in this repository.

Dataset is a csv file.


If required, the dataset can be accessed separately from its source and processed using the same pipeline implemented here.
